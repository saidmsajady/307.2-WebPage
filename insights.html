    <h3>Spain</h3>
        <p>Spain's powerful world empire of the 16th and 17th centuries ultimately yielded command of the seas to England. A peaceful transition to democracy following the death of dictator Francisco FRANCO in 1975, and rapid economic modernization gave Spain a dynamic and rapidly growing economy, and made it a global champion of freedom and human rights.</p>

     <h3>Japan</h3>
        <p>Japan opened its ports in 1854 and began to intensively modernize and industrialize. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Japan became a regional power.
